Features ✨
Data Preprocessing: Handles basic weather data cleaning and feature engineering

Random Forest Model: Predicts next-day temperatures with high accuracy

Model Evaluation: Includes MAE metric and feature importance visualization

Extensible: Easy to modify for different weather prediction tasks

Installation 🛠️
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-prediction-ml.git
cd weather-prediction-ml
Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage 🚀
Run the main script:

bash
python weather_prediction.py
The script will:

Load and preprocess the sample weather data

Train the Random Forest model

Evaluate model performance

Generate feature importance visualization
